# Pong
The assignment was mostly completed, with certain bugs remaining in regards to the bounce angle of the ball when it hit either side of the padel. In addition, if the ball meet the far top left or right corners of the Player 1 paddle, it will sometimes automatically end that "turn" and give the point to the AI. The background was made black, and the padels and ball were brightly colored as to make the items more visible to the player. For me, the easiest part of the assignment was drawing the frame, as it was very straightforward, and you could see quickly if things were drawn as they were supposed to be. The most difficult was the angle that the paddles bounced, due to the math involved. Thinking of the entire board more as a graph would have helped streamline the process for me.
